protontypes is starting a unique attempt to map all open sustainable technologies in one list. Surprisingly nobody has done this until today. On our mission to accelerate open sustainable technology we realized that it is difficult get an overview on the open technology in sustainable domains like renewable energy. 

## Sustainable and Open Technology

Open-source helps all of us to not reinvent the wheel.  Especially in the development of sustainability technology, we need to be fast and efficient. By spreading knowledge in this domain with open software, standards, tools and platforms a sustainable economy can be reached in a short timespan.  Countries like Germany or the United Kingdom now generate most of there electricity based on renewable energy [[1]](https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/germany-s-renewable-power-share-surges-to-56-amid-covid-19-impact/2-1-837212) and show others the technical prove of concept. As climate change is a global problem that is already emerging, the dissemination of this type of technology is essential to fulfill its essential purpose.

In technology domain like web technology, artificial intelligence or high performance computing the success of open standards, frameworks and methods can also been seen today. All the giant Internet companies build there platforms based on free and open technology like Docker, Linux, Python, React, Kubernetes or TensorFlow [[2]](https://protontypes.eu/about_free_innovation/). Why are we not able to repeat this success story for the most vital problems emerging today?    

## Accelerating Open and Sustainable Technology

In our search for open and sustainable technologies we have come across a number of very ambitious and high-quality projects. Unfortunately, there was no sign of activity in most of them. Many of these projects were open source but no longer advertised. As there is no project index in this area so far, it was not easy for developers worldwide to find these "gems" and develop the tools accordingly. The resulting "reinvention of the wheel" takes the time for many projects to concentrate on new innovations.  This is the reason why we have tried to focus only on active projects.  So there is a high chance that an active community will be formed around the project.  Many domains already show the emerging of a strong communities. Based on our research, we were able to identify a general trend towards open and sustainable technologies. In the last two years in particular, a large number of astonishing projects have been developed. We hope to present this qualitative impression better in the future on the basis of hard figures, but the Awesome Sustainable Technology List is already a very clear indicator. In particular, the photovoltaic and wind turbine sector shows a clear trend and a large number of professional projects.  The crowning glory is probably a 15-MW offshore wind turbine, which was developed in cooperation between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and
Technical University of Denmark. Almost all technical documentation has been provided under the MIT Open Source License [[3]](https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-15-240-RWT). This standard will enable companies and research institutions to further develop this technology without any major hurdles from Intellectual Proprietary. Many tools around the development are also available under an open license. On the basis of these technologies it is possible to secure a large part of the energy supply for entire coastal regions. Although this is a historic step, the 62 stars on GitHub show how little attention is still paid to this domain.

## Hidden Gems 

In the field of energy system modeling and climate research we found a some larger communities and projects which have evolved over a long period of time. High Quality Datasets can also be found extensively in this area. Unfortunately, even after intensive searches, some areas are still very thinly covered.  These include the areas of Energy Storage, Carbon Capture, BioEnergy, Recycling and Waste. Especially in the area of waste classification by artificial intelligence I expected a lot of software and datasets. The sad truth is that there are hundreds of large open source projects to classify and track people, but only a handful for classification and segmentation of waste within an image.  Even the largest project in this field called TACO seems to be unable to get the attention it deserves and has today no sponsors. 
 In general, the impression is that most projects are developed further by public institutions, research institutes and private individuals. Large companies can only be found in a few places. By funding such projects, it would be much easier for companies to counter their own influence on the climate in the long term.

## A Direct Comparison

Since protontypes also maintains an awesome list in the field of robotics, we are able to make a direct comparison here. The number of active and high quality projects maintained by a worldwide community is significantly larger. Many projects build on each other and simplify research and development. If we manage to transfer this successful concept to the field of sustainable technologies I am very confident that the influence of climate change and loss of other natural resources can still be averted. 

Through our organisation protontypes we will accelerate the trend towards open and sustainable technology. The list of awesome sustainable technologies is a first very central piece of the puzzle that was missing.  In this way we hope to increase the transfer of knowledge in this area and help others identify areas not covered by open toolkits and data sets.  Especially in the field of software development, this will enable people around the world to tackle one of the most central problems of our time from the comfort of their own homes. The power of open development methods is already clearly evident in many high-tech areas. Let us concentrate this power on one of the most central problems of our time.
