Over the last years software innovation was largely driven by contributors and maintainers investing their free time to improve the core infrastructure that powers our digital world today. Over 70% of the commercial source code is today based on free and open-source software [[1]](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-open-source-trends-2020-ossra/). All large big tech companies build their core platform infrastructure based on this free technology [[2]](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/whats-really-behind-microsofts-love-of-open-source/). The following plot shows the funding distributed between the larger project in 2019 on the OpenCollective platform. It is obvious  that the popularity of a project does not relate to many donations for most projects.

Today we will launch a large scale experiment to accelerate free, open and sustainable innovation. The idea of this experiment originated from a blog post of [Feross Aboukhadijeh](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/) who realized that the profit of this development only goes to the Big Tech companies and larger software projects. Most software dependencies are not considered in the compensations. Donations end up only at the maintainers, the distribution to other contributors is arbitrary and often non-existent. Commercial companies worldwide tried to solve this problem with commercial solutions like GitHub Sponsor, OpenCollective, Tidelift or Patreon [[3]](https://www.oss.fund/all/). There is no free and open-source solution to solve this problem yet. Another blog post suggests the creation of an donation pool for GitHub Actions but does not describe how the technical implemenation would look like. `there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software"`[[4]](https://vriad.com/essays/a-new-funding-model-for-open-source-software). From now on this is no longer valid:

<h3>LibreSelery</h3>

 _protontypes_ developed a new concept to remove the middleman in funding distribution with a free and open tool called [LibreSelery](https://github.com/protontypes/libreselery).  The goal is to create a platform-independent tool to sustain continuous and autonomous payout to contributors in a transparent way. Get your fresh Selery now and by integrating [LibreSelery](https://github.com/protontypes/libreselery) into any GitHub project you like. By using LibreSelery in your project you are able to involve every person of your main project and dependency tree into the profit that you make. The tool runs independently in the continous integration pipeline of your project. All sources, log files and the transaction history is fully transparent for all GitHub users. We do not charge any fees since it is not a platform. Only buying and selling cryptocurrency on the cryptomarket will create fees. For a simple integration we provide a GitHub template called SeleryAction that offers user friendly integration without using any commandline.

<h3>A Free Accelerator based on Free Funding</h3>

We support you in finding suitable [tools](https://github.com/protontypes/awesome-robotic-tooling), investors and contributors for your project. By using LibreSelery, it will be easier to find the right developers and supporters, because it ensures a transparent distribution of donations between all parties involved. 

Use the community to openly discuss the potential of your ideas. Get support in online research and and possible donation pots.
