Protontypes provides an [**Free Laboratory**](https://discourse.protontypes.eu) to bring together developers, investors and entrepreneurs in the realization of sustainable innovation. It is a place for interdisciplinary engineers and users to exchange knowledge and ideas on how to create business and innovation with the support of the community. Our focus is on the transfer of free techniques from robotics and artificial intelligence to sustainable areas such as renewable energies and mobility.

The principle of open scientific proof as in physics enables us to conquer the world. Open data, technology, evidence and software allow facts to be described and easily reproduced by others. It creates vendor-independent ecosystems and standards to advance technology and stop reinventing the wheel. Today, about 70% of source code analyses for security and risk assessment are already open source.
