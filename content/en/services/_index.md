The development of innovative products requires creative people with efficient tooling, flexible infrastructure, open organizations and agile methods. Various open source communities and projects provide a variety of sub-functions and solutions. The challenge is to combine the right tools and ensure sufficient support from the community and open source companies over the complete product life cycle. This enables to build powerful, independent and efficient ecosystems for research and development to accompany innovative products from proof-of-concepts to market release.

## Find support in the application of open technologies
{{% /blocks/section %}}

{{% blocks/section type="section" color="dark" %}}

Our services are separated into public and private support. Please check out the community for public acceleration of our product.

[**Read more**](/services/consulting/) about our commercial services, or get in touch with Protontypes and the [**community**](/community/).

 We stay in touch to multiple organization and experts for the toolset we advice to use. Our open source application engineers support you in all domains of technology integration. After identifying your requirements, we evaluate suitable technologies on which you can build. On the basis of exemplary implementations, we show you opportunities and challenges right from the start.

If no professional support can be achieved by the original open source project owner or the community, Protontypes fills this gap with expertise and resources to ensure long time support and industrialization of research code.
